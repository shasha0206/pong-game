The "Classic Pong" game implemented in Pygame faithfully recreates the iconic arcade experience. 
Players can choose between single-player and multiplayer modes, each offering unique gameplay dynamics. 
In single-player mode, players face off against an AI opponent with automated paddle movements, challenging them to maintain control over the bouncing ball.
In multiplayer mode, two players compete head-to-head using separate controls for each paddle. 
Sound effects accompany ball collisions and score updates, heightening the arcade ambiance.
The game's visual simplicity focuses on smooth paddle and ball animations, enhanced by a white dividing line and basic color schemes. 


Pong Game Code Overview
Initialization - 	Initializes Pygame, sets window caption to 'Pong', and creates a game window of 800x600 pixels.

Game Variables -	Manages variables like screen_width, screen_height, radius (ball size), velocity_x, velocity_y (ball speed), and paddle dimensions and positions.

Movement Function -	Handles paddle movement based on key presses (pygame.key.get_pressed()), distinguishing between multiplayer and single-player modes.

Drawing Function -	Draws paddles, ball, center line, and manages game visuals within the game window.

Collision Detection	- Detects collisions between the ball and paddles (collision() function), adjusts ball velocity on impact, and plays sound effects (mixer) for collisions.

Score Management -	Tracks and updates scores (score, score2), displays them on-screen during gameplay, and resets ball position and velocity upon scoring.

Game State - Management	Handles game pause (pause variable), restart (pygame.K_r), and quit (pygame.K_q) functionalities based on user input.

User Controls	- Utilizes arrow keys (pygame.K_UP, pygame.K_DOWN) for paddle movement in both single-player and multiplayer modes.

Selection Menu	- Displays initial menu options (pygame.K_1 for single player, pygame.K_2 for multiplayer) until a mode is chosen, using a conditional loop (selection flag).

Sound Effects -	Incorporates sound effects for ball collisions (pygame.mixer.music) to enhance gameplay feedback.

Game Loop -	Executes the main game loop (while not game_over:) which manages event handling, updates, rendering, and maintains a consistent frame rate (clock.tick(30)).

Graphics and Visuals - Utilizes basic shapes and colors (pygame.draw.rect(), pygame.draw.circle(), pygame.draw.line()) for game elements, enhancing visual clarity and gameplay.

Overall Gameplay	- Offers a classic Pong experience with responsive controls, accurate collision detection, and dynamic scoring mechanics suitable for both single and multiplayer modes.
